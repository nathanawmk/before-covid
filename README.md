"B.C.: Before Covid" 



Year 2020 started out like any other year

But ended like no other


They say 2020 has been unprecedented

But to say that is an understatement


New lockdowns and clusters

guessing the daily covid count deaths

watching empty shelves at the supermarket

observing mask facing and social distancing

was but the norm. 


Year 2020 started out like any other year

But ended like no other


Days became months

months became year


From covid upended careers

to work from home that stretches beyond the horizon

No one was left unscathed -- no one


Year 2020 started out like any other year

But ended like no other
