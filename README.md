"B.C.: Before Covid" 



Year 2020 started out like any other year

But ended like no other


Everyone says 2020 has been unprecedented

But to say 2020 has been unprecedented is itself an understatement


Year 2020 started out like any other year

But ended like no other


From shipwreck careers, work from home that stretches, 

Everything now seems to before covid, after covid.
